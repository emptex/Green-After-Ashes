// Green Beneath the Ashes – Scene: Field Inspection (No sprite changes)



// Linnaea and Noah stand in a post-burn restoration zone, afternoon sun casting long shadows.

Lin: The land… it’s beginning to respond.

Noah: I see it too, Dr. Ye. Those oaks over there—are those the ones you planted?

Lin: Yes. Coastal live oaks.

Lin: They survive wildfire, shade the understory, and hold the line when everything else burns.


Noah: So it’s like… a green wall?

Lin: Not a wall. More like a guide. 
Lin: It helps fire move the right way—and gives everything underneath a roof to grow under.

// They walk forward to a cleared strip in the ground.

Noah: What about this? This looks… harsh.

Lin: That’s a fire break. Traditional method: cut a line in the land and stop the fire in its tracks.

Noah: But you said we were using green breaks now, right?

Lin: We are — or trying to. A green break isn’t emptiness. 


Noah: So you’re planting forests to stop fire?

Lin: We’re planting resilience.

// Noah crouches by a fast-growing grass.

Noah: Hey, this grass grows really fast. Did you plant this too?

Lin: No. That’s cheatgrass—an invader.

Noah: Doesn’t look so bad.

Lin: It’s not what it seems. It spreads again—faster each time.


Noah: So fast-growing isn’t always good.

// They move to a dense, scrubby yellow-green shrub.

Noah: What about this one? It looks like it’s… holding on.

Lin: That’s Nevins berry. Endangered. Grows slow—but strong. Keeps the slope in place.


Noah: That sounds like… you.

Lin: (soft laugh) I’m not that patient.

Noah: So what’s the most important part? Trees? Breaks? Bushes?

Lin: The most important thing—  
Lin: is giving the system enough space to remember itself.  
Lin: And us—not interrupting that memory again.
